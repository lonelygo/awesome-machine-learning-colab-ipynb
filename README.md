[Pytorch Segmentation models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) is python library with Neural Networks for Image Segmentation based on PyTorch.

The main features of this library are:

- High level API (just two lines to create neural network)
- 4 models architectures for binary and multi class segmentation (including legendary Unet)
- 30 available encoders for each architecture
- All encoders have pre-trained weights for faster and better convergence

The Colab-notbook [cars_segmentation_(camvid).ipynb](./Segmentation/cars_segmentation_(camvid).ipynb) provided by this repo is [here](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch/blob/master/examples/cars%20segmentation%20(camvid).ipynb).
